[![Build ZMK firmware](https://github.com/dmwoods38/sweep-zmk-config/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dmwoods38/sweep-zmk-config/actions/workflows/build.yml)

# Overview
This is a very early stage repo for my Ferris Sweep, will be using Bluetooth and ZMK for this. Additionally would like to support Windows and MacOs. 
- Goals:
  - Cross Platform
  - Bluetooth
  - Decent for programming and other daily use, will use Python, Bash, Go, Rust in that order most likely for the symbols layers
  - Favor vim motions for things
  - Will stick with QWERTY as a base
  - Would eventually like to consider integrating some sort of pointing device as well so no movement from keeb.
